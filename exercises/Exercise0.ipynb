    "Coding is an incredibly useful tool that will transform how you interact with and think about data. However, just like learning any new language, getting started can be a bit frustrating.  Luckily, __[the internet](https://www.google.com)__ is there to help and is by far the most important resource and best learning tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The internet has the answer\n",
    "\n",
    "Almost every frustration you experience trying to code will have been faced by someone else. Often, they will have posted their question on a forum, and help will almost always have been offered, providing a range of solutions, some elegant, some functional, some having misunderstood the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "A key skill in coding is learning how to effectively and efficiently use the internet to solve your problem. Learn to pose your question in such a way that you get to the answer you need.  A major repository of knowledge is __[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python)__.  You will frequently find yourself on this site when googling around for how to get some code working.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another valuable site for the specifics of how python works is the __[python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/index.html)__. This is surprisingly readable, and as you get into the language is a valuable resource for writing efficient 'pythonic' code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The internet can *tell* you the answer!\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, the rise of AI models like [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/), [Claude](https://claude.ai/) and [GitHub CoPilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) have transformed how we can learn to code.\n",
    "\n",
    "These tools are very sophisticated, and can even write entire programs for you based on plain-language descriptions of what you want to achieve. However, they are not perfect, and *we do not advise doing this*. These tools are *not* aware of the data you're working with, or the science underlying what you're trying to achieve. They can be useful assistants, but you should *not* rely on them to write your code for you without understanding what it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "Good uses of AI:\n",
    " - **Learning**. If you want to understand how a piece of code works, you can paste it into one of these tools and ask it to explain how and why it works. This can provide very nice concise and useful explanations, which can be *much* more efficient than hours of Googling.\n",
    " - **Debugging**. Keep getting an error message that you don't understand? Paste the code and the error message into one of these tools and ask it to explain what's going wrong. Machines are much better at picking up on minor syntactic mistakes that our eyes might miss.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bad uses of AI:\n",
    " - **Asking it to write code for you**. This is a great way to end up with code that you don't understand, and that doesn't do what you want it to do. It's also a great way to get into trouble with plagiarism, as these tools are trained on a wide range of codebases and may inadvertently generate code that is very similar to someone else's work.\n",
    " - **Using it as a crutch**. These tools are great for helping you learn, but they are not a substitute for understanding the code you're writing. If you find yourself relying on them too heavily, you're probably not learning as much as you could be.\n",
    "\n",
    " (NB: all of these 'good' and 'bad' points were written by GitHub Copilot... even *it* knows it's not perfect!)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Online courses\n",
    "There are also an abundance of online courses for Python.  \n",
    "\n",
    "My favorite site, which is good if you already know something of how programming languages work, is __[learn_x_in_y_minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/)__.  For courses that help you from the ground up, the Engineering department has a __[great course you can access](https://notebooks.azure.com/garth-wells/libraries/CUED-IA-Computing-Michaelmas/html/00%20Part%20IA%20Michaelmas%20Term%20computing.ipynb)__ and there is also this independent site, __[Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)__, which starts from the basics (and which this course has heavily borrowed from).\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Python](https://www.python.org/)\n",
    "**Why Python?** \n",
    ">It is free, it is widely used, and it is flexible enough to be a good tool for data science and heavier programming applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a longish history, originating in the 90's. There are now two main versions in use: Python2.7 and Python3.X. You might find code online providing solutions in Python2.7, **you should code in the newer version, Python3.X**.  Be prepared to face syntax errors if you copy and paste code from the internet written for 2.7 into a Python Intepreter assuming you are giving it Python3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an object oriented language.  Objects can be a little abstract.  We will look at this concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Is Python the only option?**\n",
    "\n",
    "No! Absolutely not.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are numerous programming languages out there, each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Some popular alternatives for science include:\n",
    "- **[R](https://www.r-project.org/)** - Particularly good for statistics and data visualization.\n",
    "- **[Julia](https://julialang.org/)** - A newer language designed for high-performance numerical and scientific computing.\n",
    "- **[JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)** - Widely used for web development, but also has libraries for data visualization and analysis.\n",
    "- **[C/C++](https://isocpp.org/)** - Lower-level languages known for performance and control over system resources, often used in high-performance computing.\n",
    "- **[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)** - A systems programming language focused on safety and performance, gaining popularity in various fields including scientific computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some other popular, non-free languages, which we would encourage you to avoid if possible because they are not as accessible, and go against [FAIR data best practices](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/).\n",
    "- **[MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html)** - Widely used in engineering and scientific computing, especially for numerical analysis.\n",
    "- **[Wolfram Mathematica](https://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/)** - Known for symbolic computation and mathematical modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How these six sessions will work\n",
    "***\n",
    "These sessions will use examples to show you some of the elements of programming in Python.  To really become proficient will take time and practice, which is best achieved when you have a specific use case (e.g., your part III projects...). However, these sessions should provide a starting point and an opportunity to write code where you have demonstrators available to help, so please use them.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are files titled exercise1 etc., it is recommended you work through these in order, **but at whatever speed you want**, there are six exercises and six practical sessions when demonstrators will be on hand, but you don't need to complete one exercise per session, you may complete more or less.  \n",
    "> Please go at your own pace and focus on understanding rather than completing everything.\n",
    "\n",
    "The exercises are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* __[**Exercise 1**](Exercise1.ipynb)__ - The elements of Python coding\n",
    "* __[**Exercise 2**](Exercise2.ipynb)__ - Functions\n",
    "* __[**Exercise 3**](Exercise3.ipynb)__ - Reading in and plotting data\n",
    "* __[**Exercise 4**](Exercise4.ipynb)__ - Map making\n",
    "* __[**Exercise 5**](Exercise5.ipynb)__ - Model fitting to a dataset\n",
    "* __[**Exercise 6**](Exercise6.ipynb)__ - Random numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Each exercise will follow a similar format.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Question:** Statement of the question the exercise will address.\n",
    "1. **Objectives:** List of the exercise's learning objectives.\n",
    "1. **Examples:** Relevant code needed to complete the exercise.\n",
    "1. **Independent coding:** Guided write-your-own-code section to solve this exercise's problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each exercise is in a notebook.  Read through these, executing the example code blocks and making sure you can understand what the code is doing -- ask when you you don't understand as otherwise you will struggle to complete the exercise at the end.  Then take these elements and modify them to solve the independent coding problem. \n",

    "__[Software Carpentry](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/)__ &mdash; Inspiration on structure and how to introduce the basic elements of Python programming was taken from this site, in particular I mirrored their lists of learning objectives.  This course follows from the original scientific computing course Richard Harrison put together in Igor, elements of this have been retained."
